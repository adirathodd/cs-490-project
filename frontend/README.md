# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Typography

This project uses a small, fast typography system to ensure consistent, readable text across the app.

- Primary (body) font: Inter — loaded from Google Fonts with system fallbacks.
- Heading font: Poppins — used for H1–H6 to give clearer hierarchy. Both fonts use `display=swap` for fast rendering.

Verification steps:

1. Start the dev server: `npm start` in the `frontend` folder.
2. Open http://localhost:3000 and browse pages (Dashboard, Education, Certifications, Profile). Check:
   - Headings (H1–H3) use a slightly heavier Poppins weight and tighter line-height.
   - Body copy uses Inter at 16px with 1.5 line-height for comfortable reading.
   - Captions use smaller size and muted color (`.caption`).
3. If you need a lighter weight for specific elements, use `.font-light` (requires the 300 weight to be available).

If you want to add or change fonts, update `public/index.html` (Google Fonts import) and `src/index.css` (the `--font-family-*` variables).
