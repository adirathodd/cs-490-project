## Operational guide: Account Deletion Email Flow (UC-009)

This project implements a two-step, email-confirmed account deletion flow:

- Step 1 (Request): The user clicks Delete Account in the app, which creates a time-limited deletion request token and sends a confirmation email with a link.
- Step 2 (Confirm): The user opens the link from the email, reviews a confirmation page, and confirms. Only then is the account fully deleted (Django user, Firebase user, profile, skills, and media).

### Configure email delivery

By default in development, emails are printed to the backend logs (console backend). For real delivery, set SMTP env vars.

Option A: Use console backend (default in DEBUG)
- No configuration required. Check emails in backend logs.
- Useful for local testing. The deletion request endpoint also returns the confirm URL in development to make testing easier.

Option B: Enable real SMTP (e.g., Gmail with App Password)
1. Create a Gmail App Password (recommended; do not use your normal password):
  - Enable 2‚Äëstep verification on your Google account
  - Go to Google Account ‚Üí Security ‚Üí App passwords
  - Create a new app password for ‚ÄúMail‚Äù on ‚ÄúOther‚Äù (give it a name)
  - Copy the 16‚Äëcharacter app password
2. Set these in `backend/.env` (see `backend/.env.example` for reference):
  - DJANGO_EMAIL_BACKEND=django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend
  - EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
  - EMAIL_PORT=587
  - EMAIL_USE_TLS=True
  - EMAIL_HOST_USER=your@gmail.com
  - EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your-16-char-app-password
  - DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=Your App Name <your@gmail.com>
3. Restart backend to apply changes:
  - docker compose restart backend
  - If you just added variables for the first time, rebuild: docker compose up -d --build backend

Notes
- When DJANGO_EMAIL_BACKEND is set, it overrides the default console backend even in DEBUG.
- If you prefer another provider (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun), set the corresponding SMTP host, port, TLS/SSL, user, and password.

### End-to-end verification checklist

1. Start the stack and ensure backend can send email (console or SMTP):
  - Console backend: trigger a deletion request and watch backend logs for email output
  - SMTP backend: send a deletion request and verify you receive the email (check Spam/Promotions)
2. In the app, log in and go to Profile ‚Üí Delete Account.
3. Enter your password if asked (re-auth) and submit. You should see ‚ÄúConfirmation email sent. Please check your email to confirm deletion.‚Äù
4. Open the email and click the confirmation link.
5. Confirm on the page that loads. Your account should now be fully removed and any subsequent login should fail.

### API reference (for troubleshooting/testing)

- Request deletion (authenticated): POST `/api/users/me/delete-request`
  - Development convenience: returns `confirm_url` in JSON when DEBUG=true so you can copy/paste into a browser
- Confirm deletion: GET/POST `/api/auth/delete/confirm/<token>`
- Immediate delete (legacy): DELETE `/api/users/me` is disabled and returns guidance to use the email flow

### Troubleshooting

- Not receiving emails:
  - Check backend logs for errors
  - Verify DJANGO_EMAIL_BACKEND and SMTP settings in `backend/.env`
  - For Gmail, ensure you‚Äôre using an App Password and TLS on port 587
  - Check Spam/Promotions folders
- For quick local testing, keep the console backend and use the `confirm_url` returned by the request endpoint in development
- After changing `.env`, restart or rebuild the backend container so settings take effect
